# event_manager

This was an assignment from "The Odin Project" and this is what I learned:
 - IO class and how to manipulate streams
 - File class and how to manipulate files and directories
 - Time and Date classes. A bit confusing, but mostly due to them being so similair
 - An introduction to working with Google API's. Want a lot more practice with this
  - ERB, CVS, JSON. I'll hopefully work more with this soon as well since it's still a little vague for me.
